# Code-for-Red-River

Here is some code I've created over the years. Most are independant and will run on their own if copied into the correct IDE. Unfortunately I couldn't work out how to also attack .txt files on GitHub and therefore I've not been able to add some of the necessary files with that.

Many thanks, Max
